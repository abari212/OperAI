Operational AI 
OperAI or Operational AI develops AI applications and IoT tools with embedded AI to speed up operational processes. OperAI has expertise on developing ML/AI based tools that helped in speeding up discovery and delivery processes. Such processes usually take substantial amount of time and resources, involving multi-step procedures spanning over several years.
 
OperAI works with partners and academia to develop theoretical frameworks as a backing for the effectiveness of ML/AI applications within the sustainability perspective. With today's unprecedented growth of the Internet of things (IoT) and connected devices, massive data streams are being generated at the edge of the cloud. Operational AI helps to speed up and streamline operational processes â€‹at the edges.
