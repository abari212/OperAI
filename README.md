Operational AI 

OperAI works with partners to develop IoT devices and streamline operational processes on real-time by leveraging big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence, at the edges of the cloud. OperAI has expertise on preparing and developing Big Data/ML/AI tools that helped in speeding up discovery and delivery processes, with results considered as breakthroughs. These tools are used in research and development (R&D), including international research organisations and development agencies as well as industries, in light of industry 4.0.

Industry 4.0 refers to the current fourth industrial revolution where new technologies are all merging together, linking the real world to the digital world, involving big data, automation, ML and AI. It is named as the fourth generation in subsequent to the third industrial revolution on electronics and information technology to automate production. Industry 4.0 includes the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT), edge-to-cloud analytics, including fog analytics and cognitive analytics. The IIoT devices are poised, today, to increase production efficiency by optimizing and streamlining operations in the industrial equipment and machinery space as well as in factories and farms. 

The need to carry out real-time analytics at the edges of the cloud is driven by the rapid proliferation of IoT and sensors devices along with the increase of machine to machine communication. Timing is becoming crucial  for streamlining operational processes at these edges (IoTs), such as those related to self-driving vehicles and autonomous â€‹robots.
